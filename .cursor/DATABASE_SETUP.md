# PostgreSQL Database Setup for Cursor Background Agents

## Overview
I've fixed both environment configuration files to ensure PostgreSQL is properly set up and running automatically when you start a background agent.

## Environment Files Updated

### 1. `.cursor/environment.json` (Standard Docker Setup)
**Best for**: Development with local Docker containers
- âœ… Automatic PostgreSQL and Redis container startup
- âœ… Database readiness checks with proper wait times  
- âœ… Database initialization and migration support
- âœ… Dedicated terminal for database management
- âœ… Real-time container status monitoring

### 2. `.cursor/environment.docker-compose.json` (Docker Compose Setup)  
**Best for**: Full containerized development environment
- âœ… Complete Docker Compose orchestration
- âœ… Automatic database seeding with improved seed data
- âœ… Health checks for all services
- âœ… Database connection testing
- âœ… Application and service log monitoring

## Key Improvements Made

### Database Reliability
- **Proper wait conditions**: Uses `pg_isready` to ensure PostgreSQL is fully initialized
- **Extended timeouts**: Allows sufficient time for container startup and database initialization
- **Health checks**: Continuous monitoring of database availability
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of initialization delays

### Environment Variables
- **PG_DATABASE_URL**: Properly configured connection string
- **SERVER_URL**: Set to http://localhost:3000
- **Secure secrets**: Auto-generated APP_SECRET and database passwords

### Terminal Organization
1. **Development Server**: Waits for database readiness before starting the application
2. **Database Management**: Interactive terminal for running database commands
3. **Monitoring**: Real-time status of containers and services

## How to Use

### Starting a Background Agent
1. Press `Ctrl+E` to open the background agent panel
2. Choose the appropriate environment:
   - Use `environment.json` for standard Docker setup
   - Use `environment.docker-compose.json` for full orchestration
3. The agent will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Start Docker and database containers
   - Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready
   - Initialize the database
   - Start the development server

### Database Commands You Can Run
Once the environment is ready, you can run:
```bash
# Reset and seed the database (with improved seed data!)
npx nx database:reset twenty-server

# Run migrations only
npx nx database:migrate twenty-server

# Check database status
docker exec twenty_pg pg_isready -U postgres
```

### Monitoring
- **Container Status**: Check if PostgreSQL and Redis containers are running
- **Database Health**: Verify PostgreSQL is accepting connections
- **Application Health**: Ensure the Twenty server is responding
- **Connection Tests**: Validate database connectivity from the application

## Troubleshooting

### If PostgreSQL won't start:
1. Check Docker service: `sudo service docker status`
2. Check container logs: `docker logs twenty_pg`
3. Restart containers: `make postgres-on-docker`

### If database commands fail:
1. Verify PostgreSQL is ready: `docker exec twenty_pg pg_isready -U postgres`
2. Check environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure the development server has started successfully

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Automatic Setup**: No manual database configuration needed
2. **Improved Seed Data**: Every person is now assigned to a company (as we fixed earlier!)
3. **Reliable Startup**: Proper sequencing ensures database is ready before application starts
4. **Easy Debugging**: Multiple terminal views for monitoring different aspects
5. **Production-like**: Uses Docker containers similar to production environment

## Next Steps

When your background agent starts with either environment:
1. Wait for all services to be ready (usually 1-2 minutes)
2. The database will be automatically seeded with the improved data
3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
4. All people will now have proper company assignments!

The database setup is now fully automated and reliable for Cursor Background Agents! ðŸš€
